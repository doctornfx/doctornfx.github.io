Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm building free and open source audio plugins with Rust and [NIH-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug). This site is where I'll share:

- Plugin releases and updates
- DSP techniques and experiments
- Rust audio development tips
- Random thoughts on creative coding

## Current Projects

**Fresh Powder** - A dynamic bitcrusher with frequency-split processing and envelope-following modulation. [Try the web demo](/plugins/fresh-powder/) or grab the plugin from GitHub.

**Smooth Seas** - Coming soon...

## Why Rust?

Audio plugin development traditionally happens in C++, but Rust offers some compelling advantages:

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Excellent performance
- Great tooling and package management with Cargo
- NIH-plug framework makes VST3/CLAP development straightforward

The ability to compile to WebAssembly and ship interactive web demos alongside native plugins is just the cherry on top.

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon. Follow along on [GitHub](https://github.com/doctornfx) to see what I'm building.
