### Features

Fresh Powder combines classic sample rate reduction (downsampling) and bit depth reduction with split-frequency processing and dynamic envelope modulation. Create everything from subtle lo-fi warmth to extreme digital destruction—with intelligent bass preservation and real-time dynamic control.


- **Bitcrushing**: Reduce bit depth from 16 bits down to 1 bit
- **Downsampling**: Reduce sample rate from 44.1kHz down to 200Hz
- **Frequency Split Processing**: Keep your bass clean while crushing the highs - helps tame harsher sounds
- **Saturation**: Add harmonic warmth to the crushed signal, or completely blow it out
- **Dynamic Mode**: Envelope follower modulates the effect intensity based on your input signal
- **Real-time Visualization**: See exactly when and how the dynamic processing engages
